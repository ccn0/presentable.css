# Presentable.css

 The `STYLE.CSS` used by some of our programs to make webpages look presentable (that's why it's called that.)
 You can use it in any of your projects, as long as you credit me (@CCNO) somewhere.

## Custom Tags

use `<c` followed by the first letter of the color you want. there is only **r**ed, **y**ellow, **g**reen, **c**yan, **b**lue, and **m**agenta.
  
example: `<cr>This text is red!</cr>`  
  
`<bi>` makes text **bold** and *italic*  
`<optional>` makes text *italic* and grey (#aaa)  
`<warning>` makes text **bold** and red (#f00)  
`<monospace>` makes text monospace  
`<fancy>` makes text cursive  
`<fantasy>` makes font family fantasy  
`<box>` makes text sorrounded by a box  
  
  
## Better `<div>` elements

`<div class="topnav">` places a header at the top.  
`<div class="area">` makes a strong division arround elements  
`<div class="footer">` places a fixed tab at the bottom left of the viewport.  

## Hosting

I host it on my Github Pages site. You can link it with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ccn0.github.io/things/presentable.css">` or you can host it on your own.
